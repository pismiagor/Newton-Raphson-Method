# Newton-Raphson-Method
Here are three different types of programmes for Newton-Raphson method. You can use the method for finding root of some equations as a string. 
Also, you may evaluate functions or take derivative of them which you type in string type.
You may change number of iterations or tolerance interval.
By using constant slope, the programme will work faster.
